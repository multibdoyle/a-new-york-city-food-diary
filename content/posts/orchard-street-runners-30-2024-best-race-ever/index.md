I love running, but unlike certain masochistic members of the cardio community, I don’t get my rocks off by proving how many long and painful miles I can slug out. I like a good tempo heart rate, I like to go fast (relatively) and I like to see as much of the city as possible before winding down and easing into some brunch. Any race lasting an hour to 90 minutes is within my boundaries of ‘fun’; I have no desire to run long and hard miles for their own sake.

However, the OSR30 - a 30-mile race around the perimeter of Manhattan, give or take a few bridges and cross-town detours - is a different sort of beast, and the only sort of ultra-marathon I’ve ever had the desire to attempt. Last year’s effort ended up being a 35.5 mile tromp, which I managed to pull through despite a very cold, whipping rain and a very dead rental e-bike for my bike escort, who ended up carrying the leaden junk over bridges, up steep dirt-hill inclines and along a narrow muddy strip bordering the Hudson River.

I still haven’t bought the guy enough beers to thank him. 

I came into the 2024 race with two very valuable weapons: the lessons of experience, and my friend George, an experienced triathlete and endurance fiend even more competitive than myself. 

The race, on May 11th, started out auspiciously; runners faced a sunny blue cumulus-filled sky as we kicked off the start line and raced up 1st Avenue. Hitting my goal pace of 6:40 for the first 3 miles felt just right, a comfortably brisk tempo I could hold for upwards of 3 hours. 

By the time we reached the first checkpoint at Randall’s Island, I felt quite strong, and the day had turned gorgeous. I grinned in my checkpoint photo and set off for the Inwood Peninsula feeling hale and hearty. 

I knew from 2023 that St. Nicholas Avenue going north through Harlem is one of Manhattan’s most precipitous hills. Indeed, I was surprised my pace didn’t dip too far below 6:50 by the time I emerged into a cluster of baseball fields and playgrounds in Inwood. I followed George across the freshly cut grass, feeling like a child running through lush verdant fields in a dream, and posed with my arms crossed and my lips pouted on top of the second bench in the park. 

Running back downtown through Harlem was the only part of the race which I would call ‘dicey.’ We were creeping on mid-day at this point, just before 12 p.m.; and the thoroughfare of East Broadway was crammed with vehicles. Ripping through the sidewalks was equally as hopeless; I nearly ran over at least one Dominican grandmother carrying their groceries, very reasonably not watching their back for incoming runners trying to push the pace. 

I also lost track of George after about 160th Street. Everytime I looked behind me I just saw columns of traffic; up ahead, one of the runners I was chasing seemed to be taking a stronger and stronger lead. 

I slowed down to call George, and texted him multiple times. Checking his location, he seemed perpetually stuck on 153rd street. The prospect that he had been hit by a car became very real.

But around 130th Street, as I simultaneously tried to keep a strong pace and check my phone, I heard a familiar voice behind me. 

“We’re back,” he said, smiling and maneuvering ahead of me on the sidewalk. 

I later learned he thought I had been brained by an open car door, and had gone back to check on me. With any unsanctioned street race, you’re bound to have some uncomfortable brushes with pedestrians and even cars, but as far as I know there were no reported casualties from the race. 

Thank God. 

We cut over to the West Side Highway around 125th; WSH is also where my blow-up at last year’s race occurred; I had to fight back PTSD as I coasted through mile 20. One very persistent thought began to take over:

“When am I going to bonk?”

Around mile 22, running nearly perpendicular to the Midtown Manhattan street where I live with my fiance, I heard someone call my name. I immediately recognized one of my co-workers on the side of the walkway, a fellow endurance enthusiast who knew I would be racing that day. We exchanged shouts of appreciation, and I picked up my pace just a bit. Encouragement is amazing fuel. 

George recommended I watch my heartrate as I cut into mile 24; sure enough, I was in the low 170s, around my zone 4. And I was starting to feel it - not bonking, not muscle failure, but just exhaustion. Pure tiredness. I slowed down a half step, attempting to keep my heart rate below 170. My mile times subsequently slowed to around the 7 minute mark. 

Coming onto the third checkpoint at Little Island, I had consumed a full water bottle full of NuuN water, as well as at least 4 GU gels. The fueling strategy had kept me from crashing so far, but I was still on high-alert; crashing can be sudden and merciless. One minute you’re pulling your tempo pace, the next you’re doing the old-man shuffle. 

I hit the marathon checkpoint at 2:58; not shabby, and I was still feeling strong enough, though cautious - in retrospect, entirely too cautious - about controlling for the dreaded wall. 

It took a little encounter with a guy in sunglasses and a very expensive looking camel coat, who got tangled up with George, to snap me out of my circumspection. The guy - probably out on a morning walk, definitely not expecting or deserving of the verbal harassment he was about to experience - did not look onto the bike path and scolded George as he untangled himself. Immediately, I went into defense mode for my biker. 

It doesn’t really matter what I said to the guy, because I’ve already repented at church, and as my religion teaches me if you ask for forgiveness then it didn’t really happen in the eyes of God.
But George came away with the one-liner of the day. 

“Have fun with your third wife!” he shouted to the guileless man, as we steadied ourselves and continued to zip south towards the fourth checkpoint at the doors of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. 

A fight always gets my Irish blood going, and I knew we were within 5 kilometers of the finish. I picked up the pace - pushing just below the 6:40 territory - and after posing at the Staten Island Terminal, let ‘er rip. 

Besides a few painful calf knots as I ascended up the sloping hill of Pike Street, and a wrong turn at East Broadway - which very well may have cost me two places, as the 6th and 7th place finisher were all within seconds of me - the finish was as strong as I could have asked for. I clocked 29.5 miles in 3 hours and 20 seconds, feeling great. Feeling, in fact, like I had more in the tank. 

But, that will be for next year. I proceeded to eat heaping plates of spaetzle, mashed potatoes and meatballs courtesy of Cafe Katja. The line for beer was too long, else I would’ve gotten myself a steiner. No matter; I would have more than my share of drinks later that night, when I bounced between the West Village with George and the East Village with my biker from the prior year, Matt. Many espresso martinis were quaffed.

And at the end of the day, isn’t that why we all run? So we can drink espresso martinis with our friends on a guilt-free New York City Saturday night? 

Until next time. 










An average Tuesday night tempo run may include former NCAA stars, Olympic trials qualiifers and full-fledged Olympians. Anybody can show up, although if your easily lost in the city and the idea of playing chicken with oncoming traffic while going at sub-6 minute / mile pace is not appealing to you then you might want to take your talents elsewhere. 





















I rented an e-bike from a Central Park bike rental company down the block from my apartment; the battery died about 13 miles in, and my very athletic friend who I had briefed very minimally on the adventure had to carry the bike over bridges, up steep dirt-hill inclines and along narrow strips of muddy ground between a fence and a river. 

First, the Orchard Street Runners are a brand unto themselves, an unofficial ‘running club’ for people who love running but want to move beyond the monotony of gassing laps around a track. OSR centers on a Tuesday night tempo run starting in the Lower East Side. The group is fast, very fast on some nights - the leaders may hover between 5:30 and 5:50-per-mile pace while zipping between cars across busy Manhattan / Brooklyn evening traffic. Newcomers who expect an encouraging coach leading the way and shouting them affirmations will be disappointed; if you don’t know the route, and you’re not willing to follow other runners playing chicken with oncoming cars and pedestrians, you’ll likely find yourself lost and more than a little disoriented, blinkered under the bright city lights and wondering how you ended up sweaty outside a Red Hook bar at 7:30 on a Tuesday. 



I hit the 26.2 mile mark at almost exactly 2:50; almost immediately, the muscles in my legs felt like they had been turned to syrup. Even after we got back on solid ground on the West Side Highway, my mile splits seemed to get slower and slower as if there were some little demon chipping away at any remaining will to run I had. 

Sub-6 minute miles turned to high 6 minutes turned to 8 minutes turned to 9 minutes turned to - cringe - 12 minutes / mile. By the time I was hobbling across the Manhattan bridge to the finish line, entire packs of runners were happily jaunting past me. I still somehow finished middle of the pack, averaging about 7:25ish pace for the entire hellscape. 





Running for me is both a joy and a flex; I love the dopamine rush, I love setting PRs and I love beating people. Related to this, I have a severe aversion to some of the misguided souls who use their running as an excuse to extol the virtues of pain and mental fortitude. The runners I hear yelling ‘embrace the suck’ are usually the ones who, well, suck. If running really sucks for you that bad, go find something you enjoy, and let the rest of us have fun with our short-shorts and energy goos. 

All that to say, I’m not that fast. But I’m fast enough to scratch a certain competitive itch, and like many nerdy solipsistic runners I think my reasons for running are the truest and purest. Competition, dopamine,  

So, ultra-marathons for me are kind of a mixed bag of emotion. It feels like the kind of things some people sign up for because they know they’re not good enough at shorter distances, but they’re competitive and they think the sample size at the longer distances will be such that maybe - just maybe - they can claim something cool like an age-group award. 

That’s the only reason I would ever do one, anyway.
