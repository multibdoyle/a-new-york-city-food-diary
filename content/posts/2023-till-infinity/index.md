A long time ago, I had a food blog, which I thought would be a novel way of getting my writing out to the world. My a priori faulty reasoning was that audiences would prefer a 500-word blog post over a well-shot TikTok food ASMR video. Whatever, I’m no stranger to humiliation; the food posts will stay on this relaunched site as a testimony to aggressively earnest writing in the age of COVID.

The world’s changed a bit since I wrote my last review; the kids are not alright, Paris is burning, New York City has the worst air quality of any metropolis in the world, and that’s just the news this week. 

Maybe this time around, I’ll focus less on the ephemeral day-to-day commentary, and food, and things of the flesh - Lord help me, I can’t get away from Christian-ese - and way more on the things of the spirit. Things that will last. 

Like blockchain! That’s not going anywhere, right? 

Stay tuned for more.
